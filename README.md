# Tiniest Sudoku Solver

## Why?

Because 1) I am an engineer and 2) I downloaded an iPhone suduko game, therefore 3) I had to build a solver.

## What

The solver is a small self-testing Python 2 program that uses a simplistic game tree model to brute force a solution.

## How

The repo includes an example "expert" puzzle (according to my iPhone game), which you can solve by running
```sh
./solver expert.txt
```
